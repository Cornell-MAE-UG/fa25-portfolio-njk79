My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a mechanical engineering student who loves to understand how things work and how to make them better. I'm especially excited by hands on engineering projects that allow me to combine technical skill with creative design. I'm constantly working to expand my knowledge and skillset and I enjoy challenging myself with meaninful and collaborative work.
