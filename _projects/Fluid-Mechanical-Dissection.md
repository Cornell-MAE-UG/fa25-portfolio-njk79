In the fluid mechanical dissection, my team and I dissected and analyzed a salon chair hydraulic lift in order to better understand how fluid pressure and other mechanical elements work together to amplify force. We connected the physical system that we took apart to the fluid mechanics concepts that we learned this past semester by modeling how it works and explaining the physics/mechanisms.

For this fluid mechanical dissection, I contributed to taking apart the saloon chair pump while documenting photo and video evidence. Furthermore, I collaborated with my group in creating a slideshow to present our dissection and describe the fluid mechanics that we discovered about it. I specifically made slides that focued on the mechanical advantage of the saloon chair and then presented about that in my video recording. Lastly I edited the full video together while ensuring that the time requirement was met.
