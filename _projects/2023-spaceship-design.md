For this fluid mechanical dissection, I contributed to taking apart the saloon chair pump while documenting photo and video evidence. Furthermore, I collaborated with my group in creating a slideshow to present our dissection and describe the fluid mechanics that we discovered about it. I specifically made slides that focued on the mechanical advantage of the saloon chair and then presented about that in my video recording. Lastly I edited the full video together while ensuring that the time requirement was met.
